## Python Projects

Here are some notable **Python projects** I have worked on, demonstrating both individual and group contributions:

### 1. CICIDS2017 Decision Tree for Cyber Attack Detection
- **Type:** Individual Project
- **Objective:** Detect simple cyber attacks (Bruteforce, basic web attacks, DOS, DDOS, BOTs) using a fully custom-built **decision tree** without any built-in ML libraries.
- **Dataset:** CICIDS2017 (sample of 15,000 records).
- **Key Features:**
  - Data preprocessing, splitting, and decision tree construction from scratch.
  - Manual calculation of Gini, entropy, and information gain.
  - Prediction, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree structure.
- **Skills Used:** Python, algorithms, data structures, cybersecurity analytics.

### 2. CodeScraper – Villa Data Aggregation & Comparison
- **Type:** Group Project
- **Objective:** Scrape and aggregate villa listings from **two well-known real estate websites**, compare similar listings using machine learning, and identify the best price and listing.
- **Key Features:**
  - Web scraping with **Selenium**, **BeautifulSoup**, and **Requests**.
  - Detect duplicate listings across websites using **scikit-learn** algorithms.
  - Store data in **SQL database**, and export results in clean **Excel files**.
- **Skills Used:** Python, web scraping, machine learning, SQL, data analysis.

### 3. Quoridor-like Console Game
- **Type:** Group Project
- **Objective:** Build a **two-player console board game** inspired by Quoridor with full game logic, path validation, and persistent player stats.
- **Key Features:**
  - Player registration, login, and secure password hashing with **bcrypt**.
  - Turn-based gameplay with piece movement and wall placement.
  - DFS-based path checking to ensure valid moves.
  - Save/load functionality using JSON.
  - Dynamic leaderboard showing wins and losses.
  - Colored terminal UI using **rich** and **colorama**.
- **Skills Used:** Python, algorithms, data structures, user authentication, console UI.
