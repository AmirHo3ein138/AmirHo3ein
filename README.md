## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm `Seyed Amirhossein`, and I'm a student who study `CS` in **IUST** ( *It stands for Iran University of Sience and Technology*) and like to learn Languages and Oprating Systems like Linux .
My top Goal in Bachelor's degree is to be Professional at coding and try to be hired in part-time job (or maybe fulltime :) ).
